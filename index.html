                    <p class="article--section-bio">Congressman Jim Cooper was born and raised in Tennessee. He and Martha, his wife of twenty eight years, live in Nashville and have three children.
                    
                    <p class="article--section-bio">A New York Times columnist recently called him "the House's conscience, a lonely voice for civility in this ugly era" and a "tart-tongued moderate" who "seeks bipartisanship on fiscal matters and other issues in a polarized political climate." USA Today named him one of the "Brave 38" of a "tiny band of heroes" in Congress for his work on a bipartisan budget plan.</p>
                    
                    <p class="article--section-bio">In Congress, he's known for his work on the federal budget, health care and government reform. </p>
